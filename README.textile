Yet another cappu MapKit fork totally incompatible with other forks. Sorry for that but I couldn't find a stable v3 based MapKit although there is a lot of good stuff out there but very disparate.

A lot of stuff is borrowed from other forks:
MKMapView comes mainly from cappuccino/MapKit before v3 support was reverted.
MKAnnotation and MKPlacemark is from mafis/MapKit + initial binding support for centerCoordinate.
MKGeocoder is new and mimics iOS 5 class CLGeocoder. Supports both geocoding and reverse geocoding but you need a loaded map first.

There is a test for a cib-based MapView also testing the geocoding feature.
